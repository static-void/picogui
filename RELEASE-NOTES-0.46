- PicoGUI v0.46 "Lagbored" -

------------ Release Notes

The major changes in this release include:

 - the repository changed from CVS to Subversion. Not that this affects the
   average end-user, but it's still important.
 - new directory layout. For example, now themes are under (surprise) themes, and
   all client libraries are under client.
 - PicoGUI now compiles and runs under Windows, with cygwin, mingw, or msvc. The
   only drivers supported are SDL.
 - other new drivers; notably, very alphaish DirectFB support.
 - bugfixes, lots of them

As always, this isn't meant to be a stable release, it is only provided so
people can more easily experiment with PicoGUI and possibly help in its
development.
 
-------------- To get started:

 - If you're still fuzzy on what this is supposed to be exactly, take a look
   at some of the docs at http://picogui.org, specifically the FAQ.
   
 - If you're wondering what order you should examine the packages here, please
   read very carefully the INSTALL document located in this same directory.
   
 - Read all the README files and INSTALL in the pgserver directory!
   The PicoGUI server has a lot of compile time options. The defaults are
   reasonable for developing picogui apps on a desktop, but this is where you
   can tweak picogui for different confgurations.
   
 - Note that there is also a good deal of optional runtime configuration,
   documented in README.configfile, and to a lesser extent in the output of
   "pgserver -h"
   
 - If you still have questions, send them to the pgui-devel mailing list
   (at http://picogui.org) or drop by #picogui on irc.freenode.net and ask.
   
Have a lot of fun!
